# Master Index

This repo contains the script that is used to generate and keep
updated the master COSIMA Cookbook database.

It is resides in

```
/g/data/ik11/databases
```

and the status of the jenkins job that runs the update daily is accessible
here:

https://accessdev.nci.org.au/jenkins/blue/organizations/jenkins/COSIMA%2FCC%20Database%20Build/activity


Currently all model outputs in the `outputs` directory are indexed, as as
all forcing datasets under `inputs/JRA55`
